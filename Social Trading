Social trading is becoming popular among Forex platforms. 
Instead of spending a lot of time for analyzing the market trends, positions, and options, users can copy from the professional traders and replicate what they do to minimize their risks and maximize their ROIs.
 
But how social trading works on SynchroBit™?
Users of social trading are categorized into two groups; 
Lead-makers and lead takers. Lead makers are the users that want to allow other users to colon their portfolio and 
replicate their trading activities. 
And, lead-takers are those who wish to copy and replicates the trading activities of lead makers.


When a user wants to copy a Lead Market, he needs to accept the terms and conditions for social trading, 
including the fees to be paid to the Lead Maker and SynchroBit™. These fees are a marginal percentage from the profit 
he would make from social trading, which means the user will only Pay by Result (PBR).

Social trading is profitable for both Lead Maker and the Lead Taker; professional users can earn more income from 
sharing their trade strategies and portfolios with the other users and, in the meantime, other users can minimize their 
risks and maximize their ROIs by replicating the strategies and portfolios of professional users. 
 
Social trading will be available on the crypto market, the valuable goods market, and the stock market on SynchroBit™ 
for both binary options and merging trading.
